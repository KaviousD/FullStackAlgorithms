# FullStackAlgorithms
To wrap up DSA week, use the algorithms you've created in the context of an application. Build it as complex or as simply as you'd like with Node, .NET or any stack you choose.
Fork this repo and Happy Coding!

# Required Algorithms

## A Sorting algorithm

### Insertion Sort
You should have completed this from Tuesday's coding exercises. Any other sorting algorithm is fine to use, however.

# Add

Add a form or some sort of interaction in the frontend of your app to send 2 integers, ranging from 1 to 1000, to a server route that returns a sum from your add function.

# Day of the Programmer

Add a form or some sort of interaction in the frontend of your app that sends a year from 1700 to 2700 to your server and returns the 256th day of that year.


# Required Pages

## Splash Page
Use a nice header and fancy image. Try Meta.ai or some free image generator or stock image and some creative CSS.

## Home Page
This page should display sorted data from your server. Use the data.json file as your source of data.

## About Page
Describe what you've learned this week, or in this course.

## Functions Page
Have your frontend call the 3 algorithms in the backend with user generated inputs as parameters.
The frontend should display the response from your backend.


# Deploy
Use a deployment server of your choice. 
Github Pages can host a frontend application.
Render should work for most backend applications. 
Azure is still an open option as well for deploying your server.
Don't forget to configure any environment variables and/or links so that your frontend is calling your backend correctly. 
Fetching to localhost is a no no
